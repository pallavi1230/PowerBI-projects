## AirBnB Dataset Analysis
### Business Understanding
Analyse the listed attributes to gain insight in terms of booking location, rating, price, room type,
property type, yearly , monthly and weekly trends. 

### Data Understanding
The given data set presents two tables- 
First one has all the basic info about the Venue listed under Airbnb, so tried to explore all the attributes, 
with their data range, min & max values, no. of unique items, null rows , blank rows , rows with 0 and blank 
values and how we could impute them with respect to other attributes.

The second table has data related to reviews , reviewer id, review date, and listing id. Connected both the 
tables to get an overview about the listings.

### Data Cleaning
Performed exploratory data analysis using python to explore the measures of central tendency for discreet, 
continuous and categorical method to impute missing values with right approach. Perfomed cleaning of data 
as in many cases the least value was 0 which is non-feasible, a large section of rows were blank etc.

### Data Analysis
To perform analysis created two dynamic  dashboard , one with all basic info , and the second one analysing
Location and Price of listings based on various other factors.
